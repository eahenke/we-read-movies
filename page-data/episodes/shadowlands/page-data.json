No, not that Shadowlands... No, not that Shadowlands either... The other one. The gay one. Okay, well, they made a gay movie called Shadowlands and someone fucks a ghost in it. It's not surprising that you've never heard of it, but I promise you it's real. You can watch it on Tubi if you want, but don't bother, it wasn't good. Anyway, that's the movie we watched this week.","duration":"1:18:55","num":77,"src":"https://media.zencast.fm/we-read-movies/77.mp3","topics":["Which painting would you have sex with?","Ghost sex","The mysterious death of Edgar Allan Poe","What do our dreams mean?"],"links":[],"cover":null},"artistsJson":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"shadowlands","artist":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3404482311","392073698","764694655"]}
