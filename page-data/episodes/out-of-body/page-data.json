When a demon is released from an orb (you know how all orbs have demons living inside them?), and possesses the body of Malcolm, it's up to his best friend Henry (who's secretly in love with him) to get it back. Or that's what the description on IMDb would have you believe. Mostly Malcolm just tries to get Henry laid from beyond the grave for some reason, and then the movie kind of ends.","duration":"1:28:06","num":101,"src":"https://media.zencast.fm/we-read-movies/102.mp3","topics":["America's favorite serial killer","Ginny Thomas's safe word","The difference between red and salmon","How would we include RuPaul in this movie?
